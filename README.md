## Options

### SSL

Information on the web:

* [Generating a KeyStore and TrustStore](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19509-01/820-3503/6nf1il6er/index.html)
* [Configuring JSSE System Properties](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Fuse_MQ_Enterprise/7.1/html/Security_Guide/files/SSL-SysProps.html)

#### TrustStore

Only the types JKS and JCEKS (not PKCS #12) are supported for TrustStore
(`--ssl-truststore-type`).
You do not need to specify the password (`--ssl-truststore-password`) â€“
it seems that the CA certificates in the keystore are not password protected.

#### KeyStore

The KeyStore must be protected by a non-empty password
(`--ssl-keystore-password`).
All the private keys in a JKS or JCEKS KeyStore must be protected by the same password as the KeyStore.
